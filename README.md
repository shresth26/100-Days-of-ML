<h1>100-Days-of-ML</h1>

<h2> Day 1 (02-04-2020) : MNIST GAN </h2>

* Today I studied the concept of GAN(Generative Adversarial Network).

* Implemented DCGAN(Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) on the MNIST dataset to generate handwritten digits.

* I Would love to explore the applications of GAN in the upcoming days.

<h2> Day 2 (03-04-2020) : Regularization and Optimization </h2>

* Studied various regularization techniques in order to handle overfitting.

* Completed Week 1 assignment of the Andrew Ng Deep Learning course.

* Explored various optimization algorithms such as Gradient descent with momentum, RMSprop and Adam.

* Completed Week 2 assignment of the same course.

<h2> Day 3 (04-04-2020) : FACE-GAN </h2>

* Implemented DCGAN(Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) on the face dataset to generate human faces.

* The image generated was not upto the mark and would need some modification. 

* The dataset is available <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/gasgallo/faces-data-new" > Here </a>

* Link to the notebook is available <a href = "https://github.com/shresth26/100-Days-of-ML/blob/master/DAY-3/Face_Gan.ipynb" >        here </a>

<h2> Day 4 (05-05-2020) : Structural Machine Learning </h2>

* Learnt about Machine Learning structural strategies used in the industry.

* Read about terms like Avoidable bias and variance on the dataset and about Bayes error.

* Read about Transfer Learning, Multi-task learning and end-to-end deep learning.

* Completed the course 3 of the deep learning series by Andrew Ng.

<h2> Day 5 (06-05-2020) : Clustering in Machine Learning </h2>
  
  * Today I studied about the various clustering algorithms used in ML.
  
  * The list includes : K-means, Mean-shift, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering.
  
  * Analysed the pros and cons of each algorithm and the applications of each of them.
  
  * Looking forward to implement them in the coming days.

   <h2> Day 6 (07-04-2020) : Convolution </h2>
   
   * Today I started course 4 of the Deep Learning Series by deeplearning.ai
   
   * Week 1 turned out to be a quick recap of Convolution Neural Network (CNN).
   
   * The topics covered today included padding, strides, convolutions and MaxPooling.
   
   * The course is available <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning " > Here. </a>
