<h1>100-Days-of-ML</h1>

<h2> Day 1 (02-04-2020) : MNIST GAN </h2>

* Today I studied the concept of GAN(Generative Adversarial Network).

* Implemented DCGAN(Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) on the MNIST dataset to generate handwritten digits.

* I Would love to explore the applications of GAN in the upcoming days.

<h2> Day 4 (05-05-2020) : Structural Machine Learning </h2>

* Learnt about Machine Learning structural strategies used in the industry.

* Read about terms like Avoidable bias and variance on the dataset and about Bayes error.

* Read about Transfer Learning, Multi-task learning and end-to-end deep learning.

* Completed the course 3 of the deep learning series by Andrew Ng.

<h2> Day 5 (06-05-2020) : Clustering in Machine Learning </h2>

* Today I studied about the various clustering algorithms used in ML.

* The list includes : K-means, Mean-shift, Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering.

* Analysed the pros and cons of each algorithm and the applications of each of them.

* Looking forward to implement them in the coming days.

<h2> Day 6 (07-04-2020) : Convolution </h2>

* Today I started course 4 of the Deep Learning Series by deeplearning.ai

* Week 1 turned out to be a quick recap of Convolution Neural Network (CNN).

* The topics covered today included padding, strides, convolutions and MaxPooling.

* The course is available <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks?specialization=deep-learning " > Here. </a>

<h2> Day 7 (08-04-2020) : Colorization </h2>

* Today I worked on the conversion of black images to images of color.

* Used OpenCV and Deep Learning to implement the program.

* The model used was pre-trained on the Caffe deep learning framework on ImageNet dataset.

* You can refer to the paper <a href = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511.pdf" > here </a> and to the documentation <a href = "https://github.com/richzhang/colorization" > here </a>

* The results were plausible.

<h2> Day 8 (09-04-2020) : Background of CNN </h2>

* Today I dived deeper into the background of CNN.

* I wrote the code for it to understand what happens behind the scenes.

* It's always good to know about the theory and code of the pre-defined functions used directly by us.

* I implemented the model on the 'signs' dataset.


<h2> Day 9 (10-04-2020) : PyTorch </h2>

* Today I started learning about the basics of the PyTorch deep learning framework.

* Looked up the differences between Tensorflow and PyTorch.

* Implemented the framework on the University of California car dataset.

* Here's the notebook for it. ![notebook](https://github.com/shresth26/100-Days-of-ML/blob/master/DAY-9/CarPrice.ipynb)

<h2> Day 10 (11-04-2020) : ResNet and Inception </h2>

* Today I started Week 2 of the fourth course in the Deep learning specialization.

* Various architectures like ResNet, AlexNet and Inception were discussed in detail.
