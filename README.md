<h1>100-Days-of-ML</h1>

<h2> Day 1 (02-04-2020) : MNIST GAN </h2>

* Today I studied the concept of GAN(Generative Adversarial Network).

* Implemented DCGAN(Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) on the MNIST dataset to generate handwritten digits.

* I Would love to explore the applications of GAN in the upcoming days.

<h2> Day 2 (03-04-2020) : Regularization and Optimization </h2>

* Studied various regularization techniques in order to handle overfitting.

* Completed Week 1 assignment of the Andrew Ng Deep Learning course.

* Explored various optimization algorithms such as Gradient descent with momentum, RMSprop and Adam.

* Completed Week 2 assignment of the same course.
